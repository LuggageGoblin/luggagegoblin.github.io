		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>
			Here’s a look at some of my personal and professional projects across disciplines-ranging from software development to cosplay replicas to hand-painted miniatures.

			<h3>Software Projects</h3>
			<p>These are tools, experiments, or applications I've developed for fun, school, or clients.</p>
			<div class="gallery-item grouped large-preview">
				<h2>ST Dispenser</h2>
				<div class="image-set">
					<img src="images/software/st_dispenser.jpg" alt="ST Soap Dispenser" />
					<img src="images/software/st_dispenser2.jpg" alt="ST Soap Dispenser" />
					<img src="images/software/st_dispenser3.jpg" alt="ST Soap Dispenser" />
				</div>
				<div class="caption">This project is a display model of a high tech soap dispenser, built from scratch I integrated buttons to control the screen display, and LED lights to give the display model the finishing touch that shows off the product well.</div>

				<h2>Pathfinder Cantrip Cards</h2>
				<div class="image-set">
					<img src="images/software/cantrip_cards.png"
				</div>
				<div class="caption">This project lives on <a href="https://luggagegoblin.itch.io/cantrip-cards"target="_blank">itch.io</a> but it is a tool I developed which 
				selects randomly from cantrip spells in Pathfinder 2nd edition. This was built as a tool for the Dungeon Master running the game, randomly selecting 10-16 items 
				from a small list can be tedious, let alone a list of 120 spells. So far this tool has saved much time for the players which have chosen to open up the custom item 
				called "cantrip booster packs." Our group has a heavy overlap of people who play Magic the Gathering, and the Dengeon Master thought it would be a fun addition to 
				include booster packs into our Pathfinder game.</div>

                <h3>Professional Snapshot</h3>
                <p>
                    I hold a B.S. in Computer Science with a Mathematics minor from ECSU (Class of 2024), and specialize in game development, software prototyping, and digital tools. I'm passionate about solving complex problems with creativity and code, and love working on multidisciplinary projects.

                <h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm fluent in Python and C#, and have professional experience with Git, version control, and collaborative workflows. I regularly build games in Godot and develop assets using Blender and Krita. I'm also comfortable in both Microsoft 365 and Google Suite ecosystems.

                <h3>How I Work</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a detail-oriented, self-driven developer who thrives in iterative environments. I bring an eye for design and an ability to pivot between high-level systems thinking and low-level debugging. I also enjoy rapid prototyping and polishing features for real users.

                <h3>Why Games?</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been fascinated by old game mechanics—especially forgotten genres or prototypes that never got the spotlight. I like to take those ideas, break them apart, and rebuild them in new ways. Games are a way to communicate, challenge, and inspire all at once.

                <h3>Upcoming Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a few projects that I am currently working on, the most exciting one is a Laser Mosquito Zapper. I am going to be using AI to identify mosquitoes, and use a laser to shoot them once they are identified.
                    This is a larger project for sure, but I will be sure to update my project page, and home page when I have finished work on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another project I am currently working on is an indie horror game, based on my experience working at a butcher shop. The premise is a survival horror game where you need to complete daily work tasks in order to survive,
                    the player faces obstacles in the form of customers, co-workers, and even the meat itself. When I finish work on this I will be sure to update my games page, and add a page dedicated for it.

                <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I love 3D printing and hand-painting models (check out my Pip-Boy!), participating in game jams, and experimenting with digital art. I also enjoy tinkering with tools, <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/bfbb/runs/zqj46g5m" target="_blank">speed-running</a> old games, and playing table top games for fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I truly have a strong passion for anything that has the potential to combine the creative with the competitive. Some of my favorite games are Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, and Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom.  
                </p>
                <p>
                   Each of these games exemplifies my passion for creative, and competitive systems. While speed-running Spongebob I am constantly competing against my own best times,
                    in contrast, Dungeons and Dragons has a focus on creative play. I enjoy playing Magic the Gathering (Commander specifically) does a good deal of combining aspects of creativity in deck building with the actual
                    gameplay, competing against opponents to win.

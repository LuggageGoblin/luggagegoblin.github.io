        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Theodore Farland</strong>, and I work online as <strong>Luggage Goblin</strong>. I'm a multidisciplinary software developer with a focus on game development and design, blending creative tinkering with professional rigor. I reimagine classic game concepts, craft interactive experiences, and create 3D models that I print and paint by hand.

            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>
                My projects range from software tools to interactive art and experimental games. I enjoy reviving underexplored game concepts and exploring how mechanics can evolve. Game jams are a particular favorite — fast-paced, highly creative, and deeply technical.

            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>
                I graduated from Eastern Connecticut State University in May 2024 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. My studies gave me a strong foundation in logic, systems thinking, and collaborative development.

            <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
                I believe the best results come from combining strong technical skills with artistic curiosity. Whether it’s a game mechanic, a UI interaction, or a physical prop — I try to make each detail sing.
